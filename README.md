### INMET Database Maker
#### About:
The **National Institute of Meteorology** of Brazil provides weather station data free of charge via the website: https://bdmep.inmet.gov.br/

The data comes in *.csv* format, containing a header and a table.
I developed this script to read each of these files separately, extract the necessary information from the header, assigning them to new columns and separating only the most relevant columns to create a single weather database.

Any doubts, contact me:
